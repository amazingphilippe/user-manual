# Feedback Request

This is an anonymous form for getting feedback on how I work. My hope is that by getting candid feedback, I can become a more effective person at work and life.

Thanks so much for taking the time to fill this out!

(I won't know your identity, but always happy to discuss feedback directly too if you want to setup a meeting or coffee.)
